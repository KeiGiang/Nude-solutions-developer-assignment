# Nude Solutions - Developer Assignment

This project was developed based on the requirements set by Nude Solutions for
the sole purpose of their interview process.

## What I would like to add
* Typescript support for React frontend
* Redux/Sagas to handle FE app state & API calls
* Unit tests for both FE and BE
* Styling of the items table for nicer alignment between columns
* Update category calculations on add/remove

These are items I skipped over in consideration of the time/effort required to
learn and/or implement them.

## How to run
Start the MySQL server with
```
docker compose up -d
```
Start the application with VS or use the below command
```
dotnet watch run
```
